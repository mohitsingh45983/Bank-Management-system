##Project Description
The Bank Management System is a simple console-based application written in C++ that simulates the basic operations of a bank. It allows users to create and manage bank accounts, make deposits and withdrawals, and view customer account information. The data is stored persistently using file handling, ensuring that account information is retained between program executions.
The project is designed for learning purposes, showcasing the use of object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, file handling for data storage, and basic input/output operations in C++. It is a small-scale simulation suitable for educational use or further enhancement in a larger system.

##Features
The system supports the following functionalities:
  1.Create a new account: Users can create a new account by providing details such as account number, account holder name, account type (Savings or Current), and an initial deposit.
  2.Deposit money: Allows users to deposit an amount into their account.
  3.Withdraw money: Enables users to withdraw money from their account if they have sufficient balance.
  4.View account details: Displays the account information for a specific account, including balance and account type.
  5.Modify account information: Users can update their account details if needed.
  6.Close an account: Users can delete an existing account from the system.
  7.View all accounts: Displays a list of all accounts with their details such as account number, holder name, account type, and current balance.
